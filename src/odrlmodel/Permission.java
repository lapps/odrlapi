 * The Permission entity indicates the Actions that the assignee is permitted to

 * An ODRL policy expression MAY contain at least one Permission. 
 * It is important to verify the semantics of the Policy type attribute as this 
 * MAY indicate additional constraints on the Policy expression structure.
 *
 * If several Permission entities are referred to by a Policy, then all of them are valid.
